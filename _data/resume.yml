  summary: >
    A fifth year graduate student at UChicago, former undergrad at U. Michigan, 
    and long-time resident of a coastal city in South India. I work on
    all aspects of using structure formation for cosmology; making datasets from images, 
    generating sims, validating models, and performing cosmological inference. 
    My primary expertise is in photometric datasets, but I also work with mm-wave datasets
    from CMB surveys.
