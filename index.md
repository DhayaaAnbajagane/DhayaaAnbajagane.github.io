## Who am I?
A fifth year graduate student at UChicago and the Kavli Institute for Cosmology. I did my undergrad at the University of Michigan (go blue!), and spent the eighteen years prior to that growing up in a coastal city in south India. I pronounce my name just the way it is written (Da-ya An-buh-jug-uh-ne). My full name in the Tamil script is written as தயா அன்பழகன். The phrase தயா is a sanskrit word for compassion, 
and அன்பழகன் is derived from the tamil word for beauty and affection.


## What do I do?

My main research program is focused on answering the following question: "what happened in the first moments after the Big Bang?" I build new datasets and modelling tools to answer this question from different avenues, to build up a more coherent and robust picture. [Go here](/research.md) for a bit more detail about what I work on.


## Looking for something?

I've built a couple of tools and datasets that are in use by the community. If you got here in search of those, take a look at the [code](/code.md) tab and the [data](/data.md) tab.


## Get in touch!

If you're looking to contact me, you can find me at dhayaa at uchicago dot edu. If you're a common slack workspace (the LSST one is quite bit ;)) just send me a message!
