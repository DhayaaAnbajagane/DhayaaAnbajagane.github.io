Here's an birds-eye view of publications I've led over the years, and some details on each, organized by broader research themes. You can also look at my NASA ADS library for [all papers I've contributed to](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/V1-FHcxYRwmT62YWWRMWEQ) and also my library for only [papers I've led/co-led](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/Gcx6QK7kSjmRDvLAGnvLdQ). Details on my contributions to the former set are also in my [Curriculum Vitae](/cv.md).
