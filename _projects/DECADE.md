The Dark Energy Camera is well known for being the instrument used to conduct the Dark Energy Survey (DES), covering $$5,\!000\,{\rm deg}^2$$ of the sky. However, over the thirteen years its been taking data it has also been convering other parts of the sky. There is in fact archival data covering the entire $$20,\!000\,{\rm deg}^2$$ accessible from Chile. Given it is archival data, the image quality is highly variable and non-uniform, but the data is still usable.

### DECADE Cosmic Shear

In a series of papers:

1. [Anbajagane, Chang+ 2025a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17674) for the shear catalog generation and simulation-based calibration 
2. [Anbajagane+ 2025b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17675) for the redshift calibration 
3. [Anbajagane, Chang+ 2025c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17676) for the modelling/covariance validation and survey inhomogeneity checks
4. [Anbajagane, Chang+ 2025d](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17677) for the first results using the NGC region, and 
5. [Anbajagane, Chang+ 2025e]() for the final, NGC plus SGC results 

I led the end-to-end analysis, from pixels to calibration to modelling to cosmology, of all the DECADE image data. The final dataset covers $$9,\!000\,{\rm deg}^2$$ on its own and $$13,\!000\,{\rm deg}^2$$ when combined with DES. Our modelling uses conservative choices (scale cuts, TATT IA modelling) and delivers the highest precision lensing constraints with these choices. The dataset triples the coverage of lensing surveys on the sky. The list of data products from this are found in [my data page](/data.md).
